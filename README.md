# Memory-game

The game is all about concentration and memory training. Players click cards to open them and to match pairs with the same symbol as fast as possible and using the least moves.

## How it works

There are 8 pairs of cards in the deck. Cards are randomly shuffled each time the browser window opens or when a player clicks the restart button. Initially cards are arranged with the symbol face down. Players click a card to flip it and see the sign. Up to two cards are visible at the same time. Players must memorise the position of the cards in order to match both cards with the same symbol.

Each turn:
•	The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
•	The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
•	If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
•	If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

Additional features of the game:
-	A timer – starts measuring time starting from the first click on a card, ends measuring time when game is over, all cards are matched.
-	Moves counter – moves are counted each time the player flips two cards.
-	Stars – initially there are 3 stars, after 11 moves there are only 2 stars left, after 15 moves there is only 1 star left and after 20 moves the player gets 0 stars.
